# Carrot Citrus Crunch Recipe

No vegetarian festive spread in Mangalore is complete without Kosambari. It's a classic South Indian salad with pulses, cucumber, and a dash of mustard seeds. We usually use split green gram for that extra flavor. While some enjoy these salads as snacks, we mostly have them as part of a full-course meal. Today, I’ll share the recipe to a special version of Kosambari that my family loves – I fondly call it Carrot Citrus Crunch.

**Preparation Time:** 15 minutes

**Cooking Time:** 5 minutes

**Servings:** 4 people

## Ingredients
- 2 Carrots
- 2 Green Chillies
- ½ cup Grated Coconut
- 1 Lemon
- 2 tsp Coriander Leaves
- 2 pinch Asafoetida (Hing)
- Salt
- ¼ tsp Split black gram (urad dal)
- ½ tsp Mustard Seeds
- Oil
- 1 tsp Curry Leaves

## Preparation Steps
1. Dissolve Asafoetida in 1 tsp water
2. Grate carrots
3. Clean coriander leaves and chop
4. Squeeze lemon.

## Cooking Steps
1. In a mixing bowl, combine grated carrots, slit green chillies, lemon water, and salt
2. Add the dissolved Asafoetida water and mix well
3. Finally, incorporate grated coconut and chopped coriander leaves 
4. Prepare tempering by heating oil and adding mustard seeds, split black gram, and curry leaves until they sizzle
5. Pour the tempering over the carrot mixture and toss gently 
6. Serve the Zesty Carrot Citrus Crunch as a refreshing side dish or light salad.

Enjoy the burst of flavors!
