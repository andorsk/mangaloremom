**Pro Tips for Perfect Dosa:**
- Achieving the ideal temperature for your dosa pan is an art. A subtle yet effective method is to hover your hand over the pan without making contact. When you can feel the warmth rising, that's the sweet spot indicating the pan is ready for the batter to be poured. Waiting until you see smoke might suggest it's too hot, so trust the touch-free approach for that perfect dosa flip! 
- For seasoning the cast-iron pan, mix 4 teaspoons of sesame seed oil with 1 teaspoon of coconut oil. Then, use a silicone brush to smoothly spread a small quantity of this mix all over the pan. This ensures the dosa cooks up just right!
