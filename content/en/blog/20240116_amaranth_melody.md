**Preparation Time:** 30 minutes  
**Cooking Time:** 15 minutes  
**Servings:** 6 people

## Ingredients:
- 1 bunch medium-sized Amaranth leaves
- 1 gooseberry-sized Tamarind
- 2 tsp Fenugreek seeds (methi)
- 3 Green Chillies
- ½ tsp Turmeric
- 6 Garlic cloves
- 1 tbsp Butter
- 2 pinch Asafoetida (Hing)
- ½ tsp Mustard Seeds
- ¼ tsp Split black gram (Urad Dal)
- 1 tbsp ghee
- Salt to taste

## Preparation Steps:
1. Trim the roots of the amaranth leaves and inspect each leaf for bugs.
2. Add 2-3 tablespoons of salt to 3 or 4 cups of warm water. Stir the water continuously till the complete salt is dissolved. Now, let the amaranth leaves along with the stems sit in the solution for at least 5 minutes. This salt water soak helps to thoroughly clean it.
3. Wash the leaves 2 to 3 times in clean water.
4. Chop the leaves into small pieces and cut the stems into 3-inch segments.
5. Peel and slice the garlic vertically.
6. Soak the tamarind in water for at least 10 minutes.
7. Take 1 teaspoon of water and dissolve the Asafoetida.

## Cooking Steps:
1. Transfer the chopped leaves and stems to a cooking vessel, add turmeric, fenugreek seeds (methi), green chillies, and salt. Cook for 10 minutes.
2. Add squeezed tamarind water and butter and boil for 2 minutes.
3. Lower the heat and mix in the dissolved Asafoetida (Hing). Give it a minute and switch off the heat.
4. For tempering, use a small, deep pan to roast mustard seeds, urad dal, and sliced garlic in ghee until the seeds sizzle, taking care not to burn them. 
5. Pour the tempering over the dish. It is now ready to be served hot!

Enjoy this nutritious and flavorful **Lush Amaranth Melody**!
