**Preparation Time:** 15 minutes  
**Cooking Time:** 20 minutes  
**Servings:** 6 people  

## Ingredients:
- 600 grams Mangalore Cucumber (Sauthe)
- 1 cup Cashews
- 10 grams Tamarind
- 1 1/4 cup Grated Fresh Coconut
- 5 Long Red Chillies
- 1 Onion

## For Tempering:
- 1/2 teaspoon Mustard Seeds
- 1/4 teaspoon Split Urad Dal
- 2 teaspoons Ghee
- 1 teaspoon Chopped Curry Leaves

## Preparation Steps:
1. Peel the outer skin of the Mangalore Cucumber (Sauthe) and separate the seed portion. This portion will not be used in this recipe. To use the seed portion, check out the Mangalore Cucumber Seed Soup recipe on this website. 
2. Dice the cucumber into 1-inch pieces.

## Cooking Steps:
1. Cook the cashews and diced cucumber together by adding 2 1/2 cups of water in a pressure cooker. Cook for 2 whistles.

3. Add the ground paste to the cooked cashews and cucumber. Season with salt and boil for 2 minutes.
4. In a separate pan, heat ghee for tempering. Add mustard seeds, split urad dal, and chopped curry leaves. Once the mustard seeds start spluttering and the dal turns golden brown, add chopped onion and saut√© until golden brown.
5. Add the tempered mixture to the curry.
