**Servings:** 4 people 

## Ingredients:
- ¼ cup Red Gram (Togari bele)
- 2 Green Chillies
- 1 Tomato
- 1-inch piece of Ginger
- 1 Lemon
- ½ cup Coriander Leaves
- Salt
- 3 ¼ cups Water
- Asafoetida
- ½ tsp Jaggery
- ¼ tsp Turmeric

## For Tempering:
- ½ tsp Mustard Seeds
- ¼ tsp Split Urad Dal
- ½ tsp Jeera
- Red Chillies (optional)
- 2 tsp Ghee
- 1 tsp Chopped Curry Leaves

## Preparation Steps:
1. Peel the ginger and grate it. This will help release its flavor into the soup.
2. Wash the tomato thoroughly and chop it into small cubes. Removing the seeds is optional depending on your preference.
3. Wash the coriander leaves well and finely chop them. The fresh, aromatic flavor of coriander adds a delightful touch to the soup.

## Cooking Steps: 
1. Cook the Red Gram with 1 cup of water for 12 minutes in a multi-pot electric pressure cooker or until you hear 3 whistles in a regular pressure cooker.
2. Once cooled, blend the cooked Red Gram into a smooth paste using a mixer.
3. Transfer the blended mixture into a cooking vessel and add 2 ¼ cups of water, slit green chillies, grated ginger, chopped tomato, salt, jaggery, and turmeric. Bring the mixture to a boil for 2 minutes.
4. Add chopped coriander leaves and a pinch of asafoetida to the boiling mixture.
5. In a separate pan, heat ghee and add mustard seeds, split urad dal, jeera, red chillies (if using), and chopped curry leaves for tempering. Once the mustard seeds start spluttering, pour the tempering over the boiling soup.
6. Remove the soup from heat and squeeze in lemon juice for a final burst of flavor.
